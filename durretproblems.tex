We sometimes write $A \in \aleph_0$ to mean ``$A$ is countable''. and $A \in \aleph_1$ to mean ``$A$ is uncountable''. 

$\chi \sim N(0,1)$ means $\chi$ has a normal distribution with mean 0 and std 1.

\subsection*{1.1.1 on midterm}

We show that $(\RR, \mathcal{F}, P)$ is a probability space, where $\mathcal{F} = \{A \sub \RR \st A \in \aleph_0 \text{ or } A^c \in \aleph_0\}$ and $P(A) = 0$ if $A \in \aleph_0$ and $1$ if $A^c \in \aleph_0$. We must first show that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $A \in \mathcal{F}$. If $A \in \aleph_0$, then $A^c \in \mathcal{F}$ since $(A^c)^c = A \in \aleph_0$. If $A^c \in \aleph_0$, then $(A^c)^c = A \in \mathcal{F}$ since $A^c \in \aleph_0$.
    \item Let $(A_i) \sub \mathcal{F}$ be a countable sequence of sets. Then either $A = \bigcup A_i$ is countable or not. If $A$ is countable, then $A \in \mathcal{F}$. If $A$ is uncountable, then at least one $A_k$ must be uncountable. But $A_k \in F$, so $A_k^c \in \aleph_0$. But then $A^c = \bigcap A_i^c \sub A_k^c \in \aleph_0$. Hence $A \in F$.
\end{itemize} 

It remains to check that $P$ is a probability measure. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $A \in \mathcal{F}$. Then $P(A) = 0$ or $1$, so $P(A) \geq P(\emptyset) = 0$ since $\emptyset \in \aleph_0$.
    \item $P(\RR) = 1$ since $\RR^c = \emptyset \in \aleph_0$.
    \item Let $(A_i) \sub \mathcal{F}$ be a countable sequence of disjoint sets. We must show $P(\bigcup A_i) = \sum_i P(A_i)$. Observe that if each $A_i$ is countable, then $\bigcup A_i$ is countable and so both sides of the equality are zero. We claim that in fact at most one $A_i$ can be uncountable. In that case, $\bigcup A_i$ is uncountable and $\sum_i P(A_i) = 1$, so the equality holds. Suppose $A_i$ and $A_j$ are two uncountable disjoint sets in $\mathcal{F}$. Then, \[\RR = \emptyset^c = (A_i \cap A_j)^c = A_i^c \cup A_j^c.\] This is a contradiction, since $A_i^c \cup A_j^c$ is countable, but $\RR$ is not. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{1.1.2 on midterm}

Let $\mathcal{S}_d$ be the collection of sets of the form \[(a_1, b_1]\times ... \times (a_d, b_d]\sub \RR^d, -\infty\leq a_i < b_i \leq \infty\] and in addition the empty set. We claim that $\sigma(\mathcal{S}_d) = \mathcal{R}^d$, the Borel subsets of $\RR$. First observe that if $\mathcal{T}_d$ is the collection of sets of the form \[(a_1, b_1)\times ... \times (a_d, b_d)\sub \RR^d, -\infty\leq a_i < b_i \leq \infty\] then $\sigma(\mathcal{S}_d) = \sigma(\mathcal{T}_d)$, because if $U = (a_1, b_1)\times ... \times (a_d, b_d) \in \mathcal{T}_d$ then there is a countable sequence of sets in $\mathcal{S}_d$ whose union is $U$: specifically sets of the form $V_n = (a_1, b_1-\frac{1}{n}]\times ... \times (a_d, b_d-\frac{1}{n}]$. Similarly, since $\sigma$-algebras are also closed under countable intersection via de Morgan's laws, we can write any set of the form $(a_1, b_1]\times ... \times (a_d, b_d]$ as the intersection of sets of the form $(a_1, b_1+\frac{1}{n})\times ... \times (a_d, b_d+\frac{1}{n})$.

It remains to show that $\s(\mathcal{T}_d) = \mathcal{R}^d$. Let $A$ be any open subset of $\RR^d$. Then let $\mathcal{D}$ be the subcollection of $\mathcal{T}_d$ consisting of sets contained in $A$. Then $\bigcup_{B \in \mathcal{D}} B = A$, since if $x \in A$, then there exists an open rectangle $R$ containing $x$ contained in $A$, since $A$ is open, and $R$ is a member of $\mathcal{D}$.

\subsection*{1.1.3 on midterm}

We show that the $\sigma$-alegbra $\mathcal{R}^d$ of Borel sets in $\RR^d$ is countably generated. It suffices to provide a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{R}^d$ that generate any open subset of $\RR^d$. Let $Q$ be the following countable collection: \[Q = \{B(x, 1/n): x \in \QQ^d, n \in \NN\}\] where $B(x, 1/n) := \{y \in \RR^d: |x-y|<1/n\}$. Let $U \sub \RR^d$ be any open set. Let $Q' = Q \cap 2^U$ (i.e. the subcollection of $Q$ consisting of subsets of $U$). We claim that \[U = \bigcup_{V\in Q'} V\] Clearly $\bigcup_{V\in Q'} V \sub U$. For the other inclusion, let $x \in U$. Then, since $U$ is open, there exists a number $N \in \NN$ such that $B(x, 1/N) \sub U$. By the density of $\QQ^d \sub \RR^d$, there exists a point $p \in \QQ^d$ such that $d(x,p) < \frac{1}{2N}$. But then $x \in B(p, \frac{1}{2N})$ and this ball is a member of $Q'$ since if $z \in U^c$ is arbitrary then \[\frac{1}{N} < d(x,z) \leq d(x, p) + d(p, z) < \frac{1}{2N} + d(p,z)\] and hence $d(p,z) > \frac{1}{2N}$, implying $d(p, U^c) = \inf_{z\in U^c} d(p, z) > \frac{1}{2N}$. Thus $x \in \bigcup_{V\in Q'} V$.

\subsection*{1.1.4 on midterm}
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Suppose $F_1 \sub F_1 \sub ...$ are $\s$-algebras. We show $F := \bigcup F_i$ is a $\s$-algebra. Let $A \in F$. Then $A \in F_k$ for some $k$. Hence $A^c \in F_k \sub F$, since $F_k$ is a $\s$-algebra. If also $B \in F$ then $B \in F_j$ for some $j$. and we have $A \in F_N$ for all $N \geq k$ and $B \in F_M$ for all $M \geq j$. In particular $A \in F_s$ and $B \in F_s$, where $s = \max{j,k}$ so $A \cup B \in  F_s$ since $F_s$ is a $\s$-algebra. Hence $A \cup B \in F$, and we are done.
    \item[(ii)] If $\W = \NN$ and $F_i := \sigma(\{1\},\{2\},...,\{i\})$ then each $F_i$ is a $\s$-algebra and we have $F_i\uparrow F=\bigcup F_i$, but $F$ is not a $\s$-algebra. If $U \in F$, then $U \in F_k$ for some $k$. But every set in $F_k$ is either finite or has finite complement in $\NN$ (because union preserves finiteness or finite-complementness and because complement switches them, so you can't get anything else stating from a collection of finite sets). So every set in $F$ is finite or has finite complement. But then $F$ doesn't contain some countable unions of its own sets, such as $\{2,4,6,...\}$.
 \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{1.2.1 on midterm}

Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are random variables on $(\W,F, P)$ and let $A \in F$. We show that if $Z(\w) := X(\w)$ for $\w \in A$ and $Z(\w) := Y(\w)$ for $\w \in A^c$, then $Z$ is a random variable. Clearly $Z$ maps $\W$ to $\RR$. It remains to show that $Z$ is $F$-measurable. Let $B$ be a Borel subset of $\RR$. Then: \begin{align*}
    Z^{-1}(B) &= \{\w \in \W \st Z(\w) \in B\} \\
    &= \{\w \in A \st Z(\w) \in B\}\cup \{\w \in A^c \st Z(\w) \in B\} \\
    &= \{\w \in A \st X(\w) \in B\}\cup \{\w \in A^c \st Y(\w) \in B\} \\
    &\sub \{\w \in \W \st X(\w) \in B\}\cup \{\w \in \W \st Y(\w) \in B\} \\
    &= X^{-1}(B) \cup Y^{-1}(B) \\
    & \in F,
\end{align*} as desired.

\subsection*{1.2.2 on midterm}

Suppose $\chi \sim N(0,1)$. Using Theorem 1.2.6, we have the estimate: \[\left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4^3}\right)e^{\frac{-4^2}{2}} \leq \int_4^\infty e^{\frac{-y^2}{2}} \,dy \leq \frac{1}{4}e^{\frac{-4^2}{2}}.\] Hence: \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4^3}\right)e^{\frac{-4^2}{2}}\leq P(\chi \geq 4) \leq \frac{1}{4\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-4^2}{2}}.\] i.e. \[3.13664 \cdot 10^{-5}\leq P(\chi \geq 4) \leq 3.34575 \cdot 10^{-5}\] Note that the true value is $P(\chi \geq 4) \approx 3.16712 \cdot 10^{-5}$.

\subsection*{1.2.3 on midterm}

We show that a distribution function has only countably many discontinuities. Suppose $J \sub \RR$ is the set of discontinuities of a distribution function $F$. Observe that, for each $a \in J$, we have $F(a) - F(a-) = F(a) - \lim_{y\uparrow a} F(y) > 0$ since $F$ is discontinuous at $a$ and nondecreasing. Hence the open intervals $(F(a-), F(a)) \sub \RR$ have nonzero measure. The intervals are also disjoint, since $F$ is nondecreasing. But then, \[\{(F(a-), F(a)) \st a \in J\}\] is a collection of nonempty disjoint intervals in $\RR$. We may (by the Axiom of Choice) define a function $\phi: J \to \QQ$ via $\phi(a) = q_a$ where $q_a$ is an arbitrary rational number in the interval $(F(a-), F(a))$. This function is injective because the intervals are disjoint. Hence the cardinality of $J$ must be at most the cardinality of $\QQ$. In particular $J$ cannot be uncountable.

\subsection*{1.2.4 on midterm}

We show that if $F(x) = P(X\leq x)$ is continuous, then $Y := F(X)$ has a uniform distribution on $(0,1)$. Since $F$ is continuous, for each $y \in (0,1)$ there exists by IVT an $x \in \RR$ such that $F(x) = y$. Define $G:(0,1) \to \RR$ via $G(y) = \sup \{x \in \RR \st F(x) = y\}$. Observe that: \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] $G$ is strictly increasing, 
    \item[(b)] $G(F(x)) \geq x$ for all $x \in \RR$, and 
    \item[(c)] $F(G(y)) = y$ for all $y \in (0,1)$. \end{enumerate}
    
    Let $y \in (0,1)$ and consider the sets: \[A = \{\w \in \W \st G(F(X(\w))) \leq G(y)\}\]\[B = \{\w \in \W \st X(\w) \leq G(y)\}.\] We claim $A = B$ as follows. Let $\w \in A$. Then $X(\w) \leq G(F(X(\w))) \leq G(y)$ by (b). Hence $\w \in B$. On the other hand, if $\w \in B$, then $G(F(X(\w))) \leq G(F(G(y)))$ since both $F$ and $G$ are nondecreasing. But $G(F(G(y))) = G(y)$ by (c). Hence $\w \in A$. Therefore \[(*) \quad\quad P(G(F(X)) \leq G(y)) = P(X \leq G(y)). \] Hence, we have for any $y \in (0,1)$:\begin{align*}
    P(Y \leq y) &= P(F(X) \leq y)\\
    &= P(G(F(X)) \leq G(y)) \quad \text{by (a)} \\
    &= P(X \leq G(y))\quad \text{by ($*$)}\\
    &= F(G(y)) \\
    &= y \quad \text{by (c)}
\end{align*} as desired.

\subsection*{1.2.5}

Let $X:\W \to \RR$ be continuous with density $f$. Let $g:\RR \to \RR$ be strictly increasing and differentiable on $(a,b) \sub \RR$. We compute the density of $g(X)$.

Let $a, b \in \text{range}(g(X(\W))) \sub \RR$. Since $g$ is strictly increasing, there are unique values $g^{-1}(a)$ and $g^{-1}(b)$ such that $g(g^{-1}(a)) = a$ and $g(g^{-1}(b))=b$. Thus consider the sets: \[A = \{\w \in \W \st a \leq g(X(\w))\leq  b\}\]\[A = \{\w \in \W \st g^{-1}(a) \leq X(\w)\leq  g^{-1}(b)\}\] Since $X$ has densite $f$, we have \[P(a\leq g(X) \leq b)=P(A) = \int_{g^{-1}(a)}^{g^{-1}(b)} f(s)  \,ds.\] Note that $s \in ({g^{-1}(a)},{g^{-1}(b)})$ and hence we may make the substitution $s = g^{-1}(y)$, since $g$ is strictly increasing. Hence $g(s) = y$ and we can rewrite the integral as: \[P(a\leq g(X) \leq b) =\int_{a}^{b} \frac{f(g^{-1}(y))}{g'(g^{-1}(y))}  \,dy\] as desired.

\subsection*{1.2.6 on midterm}

Suppose $X$ has a normal distribution with density $f$. We compute the density of $Y := e^X$. By 1.2.5, $Y$ has distribution function \[P(a<Y<b)=\int_a^b \frac{f(g^{-1}(y))}{g'(g^{-1}(y))} \,dy = \int_a^b \frac{f(\ln(y))}{e^{\ln(y)}} \, dy = \int_a^b \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac12 (\ln(y))^2}}{y} \, dy\] Hence the density of $Y$ is $g(t) = \frac{1}{t\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac12 (\ln(t))^2}$.

\subsection*{1.2.7 on midterm}

Suppose $X$ has the density function $f$. We compute the density of $Y=X^2$. If $F$ is the CDF of $Y$ then: \[F(y) = P(Y\leq y) = P(X^2 \leq y) = P(|X| \leq \sqrt{y}) = P(-\sqrt{y} < X < \sqrt{y}) = \int_{-\sqrt{y}}^{\sqrt{y}} f(s) \,ds\] 

Observe that: \[F'(y) = \frac{d}{dy}\left(\int_{0}^{\sqrt{y}} f(s) \,ds - \int_{0}^{-\sqrt{y}} f(s) \,ds\right) = f(\sqrt{y})\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}} - f(-\sqrt{y})\frac{-1}{2\sqrt{y}}= \frac{f(\sqrt{y})+f(-\sqrt{y})}{2\sqrt{y}}\] and hence $F(y) = \int_{-\infty}^y \frac{f(\sqrt{y})+f(-\sqrt{y})}{2\sqrt{y}}\,dy$. 

In the case that $X$ has a normal distribution, the density is \[\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac12 (\sqrt{y})^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac12 (-\sqrt{y})^2}}{2\sqrt{y}} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{y}{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{y}{2}}}{2\sqrt{y}}=\frac{\frac{2e^{-\frac{y}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}}{2\sqrt{y}}=\frac{e^{-\frac{y}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi y}}\]

\subsection*{1.3.1 (TBD)}

\subsection*{1.3.2 on midterm}

We show that $X_1 + X_2$ is a random variable if $X_1$ and $X_2$ are. Observe that \[\{X_1 + X_2 < a\} = \{X_2 < a - X_1\} = \bigcup_{q \in \QQ} \{X_2 < q < a - X_1\} = \bigcup_{q \in \QQ}  \{X_2 < q\} \cap \{q < a - X_1\} \] but the latter is in $\mathcal{F}$, since the union is countable and since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are random variables.

\subsection*{1.3.3 on midterm}

We show that if $X_n \to X : \Omega \to \RR$ almost surely and $f$ is continuous on $\RR$, then $f(X_n) \to f(X)$ almost surely. Assume that Recall that $X_n \to X$ a.s means $P(\Omega_0) = 1$, where \[\Omega_0 = \{\omega \in \Omega\st \lim_{n\to \infty} X_n(\omega) \text{ exists}\}.\] Let \[\Omega_1 =  \{\omega \in \Omega\st \lim_{n\to \infty} f(X_n(\omega)) \text{ exists}\}.\] If $\omega \in \Omega_0$, then the limit $X(\omega) := \lim_{n\to \infty} X_n(\omega)$ exists and so, by continuity, the limit \[\lim_{x\to \infty } f(X_n(\omega)) = f(\lim_{n\to \infty} X_n(\omega)) = f(X(\omega))\] exists. Hence $\Omega_0 \sub \Omega_1$. But then $1 \geq P(\Omega_1) \geq P(\Omega_0) = 1$, hence $f(X_n) \to f(X)$ a.s.

\subsection*{1.3.5 on midterm}

Let $f:\RR \to \RR$ and let $S_a = \{x \in \RR \st f(x) \leq a\}$. We show that $f$ is lower semicontinuous (that is: $\liminf_{y\to x}f(y) \geq f(x)$ for each $x \in \RR$) iff $S_a$ is closed for each $a \in \RR$. Suppose first that $f$ is l.s.c. and let $a \in \RR$. Let $(x_n) \sub S_a$ be a sequence such that $x_n \to y$. Hence for all $n$, we have $f(x_n) \leq a$. Then: \[f(y) \leq \liminf_{y \to x} f(y) = \liminf_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) \leq a.\] Hence $a \in S_a$, so $S_a$ is closed. 

Conversely, suppose $S_a$ is closed for each $a \in \RR$. In particular, fixing $x \in \RR$ and $\e > 0$, we have that \[S = x \in \RR \st f(x) \leq f(x) - \e\] is closed. Now, observe that $x \in S^c$ since $f(x) > f(x) - \e$. Since $S^c$ is open, there exists an $N \in \NN$ and a sequence $y_k \to x$ such that $y_k \in S^c$ for all $k \geq N$. Then if $k \geq N$, we have \begin{align*}
    f(y_k) &> f(x) - \e \quad \text{ since $y_k \in S^c$} \\
    \inf_{k \geq N} f(y_k) &> f(x) - \e \quad \text{since $f(x)-\e$ is a lower bound} \\
    \sup_{N} \inf_{k \geq N} f(y_k) &\geq f(x) \quad \text{since $\e$ was arbitrary}
\end{align*} as desired. Since $x$ was arbitrary, $f$ is l.s.c. on $\RR$.

We show that if $f \geq 0$ and $\int f \, d\mu = 0$, then $f = 0$ a.e. Let $n \in \NN$ and consider the set $A_n = \{x \in \RR \st f(x) \geq \frac{1}{n}\}$. Observe that $A_n \uparrow A := \{x \in \RR \st f(x) > 0\}$. Hence, by continuity of measure from below we have $\mu(A_n)\uparrow \mu(A)$. We will show below that $\mu(A_n) = 0$, implying $\mu(A) = 0$. This gives the result because $\mu(A) = 0$ (together with $f \geq 0$) means precisely that $f = 0$ except on a set of measure zero.

Observe that for each $x \in \RR$ we have $f(x) \geq  \frac{1}{n} \mathbb{I}_{A_n}(x)$, where $\mathbb{I}_{A_n}$ is the indicator function of $A_n$, since if $x \in A_n$, then $f(x) \geq \frac{1}{n} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{n}\mathbb{I}_{A_n}(x)$ and if $x \notin A_n$, then $f(x) \geq 0 = \frac{1}{n}\mathbb{I}_{A_n}(x)$. We then have by monotonicity: \[0 = \int f \, d\mu  \geq \int  \frac{1}{n}\mathbb{I}_{A_n}(x)\, d\mu  =  \frac{1}{n}\mu(A_n) \geq 0,\] which implies $\mu(A_n) = 0$, as desired.

We prove the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, that is: if $g$ is integrable then \[\lim_{n\to\infty} \int g(x) \cos(nx) \,dx = 0.\] Suppose first that $\phi$ is a step function with finite support. Then \begin{align*}
    \int \phi(x) \cos(nx) \,dx &  =\int \sum_{k=0}^{n} \1{(a_k,b_k)} \cos(nx)  \,dx\\
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{m} \int_{a_k}^{b_k} c_k\cos(nx) \,dx \\
    &= -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{m} c_k(\sin(nb_k)- \sin(na_k))\,dx \\
    &\to 0 \quad \text{as $n \to \infty$, since $\sin$ is bounded}
\end{align*} Now, by the previous exercise, if $g$ is any integrable function, then there exists a step function $\phi$ with finite support such that $\int |g - \phi| \,dx \to 0$. Hence we have: \begin{align*}
    \bigg|\int g(x) \cos(nx) \,dx \bigg| &=\bigg|\int g(x) \cos(nx)+ \phi(x)\cos(nx) - \phi(x)\cos(nx) \,dx \bigg| \\
    &\leq \bigg|\int (g(x) -\phi(x))\cos(nx) \,dx \bigg| + \bigg|\int \phi(x)\cos(nx) \,dx \bigg|\\
    &\leq \int \big|(g(x) -\phi(x))\big|\big|\cos(nx)\big| \,dx  + \bigg|\int \phi(x)\cos(nx) \,dx \bigg|\\
    &\leq  \int\big|(g(x) -\phi(x))\big| \,dx  + \bigg|\int \phi(x)\cos(nx) \,dx \bigg| \\
    &\to 0

\subsection*{1.5.1 on midterm}

Suppose $m \in \RR$ such that $\mu(A_m)=0$ where $A_m = \{x : |g(x)| > m\}$. Then:
\begin{align*}
    \int |fg| \,d\mu  &=    \int_{A_m} |fg| \,d\mu +  \int_{A_m^c} |fg| \,d\mu\\
    &=\int |f||g| \1{A_m} \,d\mu + \int |f||g| \1{A_m^c} \,d\mu \\
    &\leq 0 + \int |f|m \,d\mu \\
    &= m \Vert f \Vert_1
\end{align*} So $\frac{1}{\Vert f \Vert_1}\int |fg| \,d\mu$ is a lower bound for $\{m \in \RR \st \mu(\{x : |g(x)| > m\}) = 0\}$, so it is also less than $\Vert f\Vert_{\infty} := \inf \{m \in \RR \st \mu(\{x : |g(x)| > m\}) = 0\}$, hence $\int |fg| \,d\mu \leq \Vert f \Vert_1\Vert f\Vert_{\infty}$ as desired.

Then $f_k \to f \cdot \1{E}$ a.e. since $E_m$ are disjoint. Note that $|f_n| \leq f$ and $f$ is integrable, so by DCT and linearity: \[\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \int_{E_m}f \,d\mu = \lim_{k\to \infty}\int f_k \,d\mu = \int f \cdot \1{E} \,d\mu=\int_{E}f \,d\mu \] as desired.

Suppose $g \geq 0$. Let $\e >0$. Then by the above, there exists $n$ large enough that $|\int_A g  -\int_A g \wedge n\,d\mu| < \e/2$. Let $\delta = \frac{\e}{2n}$ and suppose $\mu(A) < \delta$. Then: \begin{align*}
    \int_A g  \,d\mu &< \e/2 + \int_A g \wedge n\,d\mu  \\
    &\leq \e + \int_A n\,d\mu  \\
    &= \e/2 + n\mu(A) \\
    &< \e/2 + n \delta \\
    &= e
\end{align*}
Now, if $g$ is integrable, we have $|g| = g^+ + g^- = g\vee 0 + (-g)\vee 0$, which is nonnegative, and the result holds.

\subsection*{1.5.8 on midterm}

Suppose $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and define $g(x) := \int_a^x f(s) \,ds$. We show that $g$ is continuous on $(a,b)$. Let $x \in (a,b)$. Let $\e > 0$. Then, by 1.5.7, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $\int_{x}^{x + \delta} |f(s)|  \,ds < \e$. Hence, if $x <y <x+\delta$: \begin{align*}
    |g(y) - g(x)| &= \bigg| \int_a^y f(s) \,ds - \int_a^x f(s) \,ds\bigg| \\
    &= \bigg| \int_x^y f(s) \,ds \bigg|\\
    &\leq  \int_x^y |f(s)| \,ds \\
    &\leq \int_x^{x+\delta} |f(s)| \,ds \\
    &< \e
\end{align*} and we are done.
